# My C# Learning Journey

This repository serves as my personal workspace for learning the C# programming language and the .NET ecosystem. It is a structured collection of notes, code examples, and small projects that document my progress from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

*   `./Writerside/topics/`: The core of this project. It contains detailed notes and explanations on various C# concepts, written in Portuguese using JetBrains Writerside.
*   `./projects/`: A collection of simple C# console applications (`MeuApp`, `Teste`, etc.) used for hands-on practice and to apply the concepts explained in the notes.
*   `./docs/`: The compiled HTML output of the Writerside documentation, making the notes easily viewable in any web browser.
*   `./scripts/`: A set of utility shell scripts for automating common repository tasks, such as pushing to a remote or managing documentation files.
*   `./resources/`: Contains supplementary learning materials, such as books and articles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Language:** C#
*   **Framework:** .NET
*   **Documentation Tool:** JetBrains Writerside
*   **IDE:** JetBrains Rider

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build a solid and well-structured personal knowledge base for C#. By writing detailed notes and creating practical examples, I aim to solidify my understanding of the language's fundamentals and advanced features.

> **Note:** The documentation and notes within the `Writerside` directory are primarily written in Portuguese.
